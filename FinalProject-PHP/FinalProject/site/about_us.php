<h1>Midwest Brewers</h1>
<p>We have been in the brewing business for 140 years.</p>
<p>We even kept brewing during prohibition by temporarily moving the business to Canada!</p>
<p>To add, we have an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau (BBB)</p>
<br />
<h2>Giving back to local communities</h2>
<p>Every MRB bottle cap that is collected and returned to MRB recycle</p>
<p>will provide 10 cents to the local schools for recreational activites.</p>
<p>To add, every bottle of wine bought has the potential to give 10 cents</p>
<p>to any local church of your choice, by sending in the cork.</p>
